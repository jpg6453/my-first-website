# My Very First Web Page

Welcome

I built this website following a module from my Full Stack Software Developer course with Code Institute.

You can find the website by clicking [here](https://jpg6453.github.io/my-first-website/)

## Project Decsription

The project itself displays the different technologies used throughout the course. The site was built to become familiar with Cloud9, Git and GitHub.

### Technologies

The project was written in HTML and CSS in the Cloud9 editor and is hosted on my Github Repository
